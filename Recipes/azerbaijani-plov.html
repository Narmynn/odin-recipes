        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijani Plov is a traditional rice dish from Azerbaijan, often cooked with meat (lamb or chicken), onions, carrots, and various spices. It's known for its unique cooking technique where the rice is layered and cooked until fluffy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 lb lamb or chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, julienned</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dried apricots, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp saffron threads</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice and cook for 5-7 minutes until partially cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the meat and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Stir in the carrots, dried apricots, raisins, cumin, turmeric, and saffron. Cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture. Make a few holes in the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Cook for 30-40 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
